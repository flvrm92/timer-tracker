## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended; Electron 33 targets recent Node APIs)
- npm (comes with Node)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flvrm92/timer-tracker.git
   cd timer-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application (development with hot reload):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. Create distributable packages (uses Electron Forge makers):
   ```bash
   npm run make
   ```

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Create a Project**: Use the menu (Projects → Create and List) to add your first project
2. **Start Tracking**: Select a project, add a task description, and click "Start Timer"
3. **Stop & Save**: Click "Stop Timer" when finished - your time entry is automatically saved

### Managing Timers
- Access timer history via menu (Timers → List & Edit)
- Edit start/end times by clicking on the time fields
- Filter by project or date range
- Export filtered data using the "Export CSV" button

### Themes
Change themes via the View menu:
- Light mode
- Dark mode  
- System (follows OS preference)

## Running / Development Session

Follow this typical development session flow:

1. Install deps (first time only): `npm install`
2. Launch in dev mode (auto-reload main & renderer): `npm start`
3. Open DevTools if needed via menu: View → Toggle DevTools (or Ctrl+Shift+I)
4. Run tests while coding: `npm test` (one-off) or `npm run test:watch`
5. Inspect code coverage in `coverage/` after tests
6. Package the app for distribution: `npm run make`

### Database Location
The SQLite database file is created automatically at runtime. Its path is set internally via:
```
process.env.DB_PATH = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'timers.db');
```
On Windows this typically resolves to:
`C:\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Roaming\\time-tracker\\timers.db`

To use a different database during development or tests you can set `DB_PATH` before launching (tests already do this).

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Purpose | Default / How Set |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| DB_PATH  | SQLite database file path | Auto-set in `src/main/index.js` to userData/timers.db |
| NODE_ENV | Controls dev tools & hot reload | Usually `development` when running `npm start` |

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Electron (Node.js)
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Hot Reload**: electron-reloader (development)

```

### Database Schema & Migrations
The application auto-initializes and migrates the database on startup. Current schema version: 2 (tracked in `schema_version`).

```sql
-- Projects table (billable support)
CREATE TABLE projects (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   name TEXT NOT NULL,
   is_billable BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
   hourly_rate DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT NULL
);

-- Timers table (stores computed amount when billable)
CREATE TABLE timers (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   project_id INTEGER,
   start_time TEXT,
   end_time TEXT,
   duration INTEGER,
   task_description TEXT NULLABLE,
   amount_earned DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT NULL,
   FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)
);

-- Schema version tracking
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
   version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
);
```

When you start the app, migrations run automatically to add any missing billable-related columns (idempotent). No manual intervention required.

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Code Coverage
Test coverage is automatically generated and includes:
- Database operations
- IPC handlers
- CSV export functionality

View coverage reports in the `coverage/` directory after running tests.

### Development Mode
The application includes hot reload functionality when running in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
